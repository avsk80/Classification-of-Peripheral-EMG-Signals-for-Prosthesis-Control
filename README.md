# LeNet-5 with keras
LeNet-5 Architecture is perhaps the most widely known CNN architecture. This architecture 
was made by Yann LeCun. This architecture consist of the following layers.

* MNIST Image is 28x28 pixel, but it was 32x32 pixel because of applied zero padding.

# code

`data.py` is class for MNIST Data preprocessing<br/>
`lenet.py` is LeNet model implemented with keras<br/>
`plot.py` is function for loss visualization<br>
If you want to test, run `main.py`"# EMG-CNN"
